* Preface
I wish I got into this thing sooner, the configuration is really
simple and capabilities are vast. Namely proxying, https, rate limits,
static serving - all this turns out to be extremely useful.
* Tech side
I really need to get deeper into it and find some reference.

From what I've seen so far it's easy to mess up, and with nginx being
the most essential part of a setup simple errors can lead to horrible
consequences.
* Nix integration
You can assemble some pretty good nginx-aware modules with nix, which
I would love to get into.

Also RSA auth, can it be intergrated into nginx authentication
pipeline? Nginx config and nix modules would look really good on my
papers.
